# The Galahad Gigadump
During the late night hours of July 7, 2021, Alco_Rs11 (KM_Galahad's younger brother) unexpectedly discovered a treasure trove of old screenshots pertaining to TotalFreedom (May 2014 to September 2016) whilst looking through one of her previous computers' hard drives. After setting up a quick system that enabled him to copy everything to my computer via FTP, I began to dig through these screenshots and planned out how I was going to release them publically. This GitHub repository is the end result of that plan.
